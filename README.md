# Expanded Galaxy Main
Expanded Galaxy is a mod that adds the planets from the first game and a bunch of fixes / changes / additions.

I recently updated the installer to accomodate the different versions of the game ( Disc, LegacyPC & Steam ) however I have not yet tested anything other than the Steam version.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

As I am actively working on the project, things may be broken from time to time, I apologise in advance for any bugs or faults you may encounter when downloading directly from the repository.

Hoping to put out a proper release of all three parts of the project again some time soon.

## Installation
The following install order is *required* for Expanded Galaxy Main:

NOTE : Do not use the Steam Workshop for any mods when using this project.

1: (KotOR 2 TSL) [https://store.steampowered.com/app/208580/STAR_WARS_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II__The_Sith_Lords/]

2: 1.0B Patch "sw_pc_english_from200424_to210427.exe" ( GoG & Steam Users Must Skip This Step ) [https://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii/downloads/patch-1-0b-us]

3: Aspyr Patched Files ( Optional for Disc Users ) ( GoG & Steam Users Must Skip This Step ) - DOWNLOAD LINK DEAD - [https://www.gog.com/forum/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic_series/kotor_ii_drmfree_steam_update/page1]
	As I understand it, the Aspyr patch is now included with the GoG release by default, however now that the download link is dead, there is no way to apply it to the Disc version of the game.

5: M4-78EP [https://deadlystream.com/files/file/277-m4-78-enhancement-project/]
