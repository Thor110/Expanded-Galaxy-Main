Dialog Patcher for adding missing entries to DLG files to update them for use in KotOR2. ( Used heavily awaiting a small update to fix some issues )
Script Trimmer for trimming scripts so they can be decompiled. ( Created but not used yet )
Conditional Script Patcher for updating conditional scripts. ( Planned but not made or included yet )
Installer / Launcher for installing and launching the game and any Total Conversions. ( Planned but not made or included yet )

Without many of these tools the project would not have been possible.

<----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Due to the way I have structured the mod there are a lot of worlds to work with and over all a whole lot
of levels, so I am looking for people to get involved if anybody is interested and wants to work on a
story for a world.

New Areas in the game

Kashyyyk
Coruscant
Tatooine
Manaan
Yavin
Lehon
Sleheyron

There is also a new set of each planets levels for the end game free roam which are contained in their
own modules, these areas are as follows and will also need new storylines.

Telos
Nar Shaddaa
Dxun
Dantooine
Korriban
M4-78
Kashyyyk
Coruscant
Tatooine
Manaan
Yavin
Lehon
Sleheyron

Extra Planet Slot Has been used to put Peragus back onto the Galaxy Map.

A total of 13 worlds, not including Malachor V and Onderon.

If anybody is interested contact me on DeadlyStream or Discord and let me know what you had in mind.
