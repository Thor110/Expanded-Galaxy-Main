notes to myself for writing the script

compile all scripts
update all modules
recreate changes.ini

ie : generate file list, place in tslpatchdata, add numbers, delete file list, append to changes.ini template without override etc

something along those lines anyways



foldernames :
Expanded Galaxy Main Installer
Modules Source

might be tricky, but it would be good to make it so that I can work on just the level contents and update everything in the install with the click of a button

find a way to pack erf's in command line
