consider the possibility of making a set of placeables that contain the animated galaxy map

this way a variety of them can be made to represent each possible stage the galaxy map could have

IE

primary : Telos & Peragus
secondary : Telos & Peragus, TSL Worlds, Coruscant & Yavin
tertiary : Telos & Peragus, TSL Worlds, Coruscant, Yavin and M478
quaternary : Telos & Peragus, TSL Worlds, Coruscant, Yavin, M478 and K1 worlds
quinternary : Telos & Peragus, TSL Worlds, Coruscant, Yavin and K1 Worlds
sexternary : Telos & Peragus, TSL Worlds, Coruscant, Yavin, K1 Worlds, M478 and Malachor
septernary : Telos & Peragus, TSL Worlds, Coruscant, Yavin, M478 and Malachor

octonary?
novenary?

I think that covers all possible variants the animated galaxy map would need
