some files exist in the Override folder that aren't needed

specifically .gui files that were previously necessary for the manual templates to swap between the games.

these can be moved over to the "port/source/template" folder and added to the "port-file-list.txt" file.

.gui files moved, it's likely that other files are still present that aren't necessary



files to move or consider
some of the loading screens load_ etc
