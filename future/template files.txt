some files exist in the Override folder that aren't needed

specifically .gui files that were previously necessary for the manual templates to swap between the games.

these can be moved over to the "port/source/template" folder and added to the "port-file-list.txt" file.

.gui files and some other files moved, it's likely that other files are still present that aren't necessary

pebn_mystery.dlg needs renaming or something as it now exists in both games.

so the main one will override the port one
