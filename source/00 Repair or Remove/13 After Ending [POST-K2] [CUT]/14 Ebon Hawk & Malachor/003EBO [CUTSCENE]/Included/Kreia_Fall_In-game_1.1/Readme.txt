1. Description:
----------
This is a Kreia's Fall scene turned from BIK movie into in-game cutscene. 

2. Install:
----------
(It is highly recommended that you update your game to version 2.10 (the 1.0b update) before installing this mod. 
This is a mod for TSLRCM 1.8.5, it will not work otherwise. So have that installed.
To install, extract the Main Patch folder to anywhere you like, as long as it is not the SWKotOR2 folder. Simply run 'install.exe’ from within the "Main Patch" folder.

3. Uninstall:
----------
There has been a backup made of the modified files, within a folder titled 'backup' in the 'Main Patch" folder. Simply copy 003EBO.mod into your Modules folder and appearance.2da into your Override folder, and delete baseitems.2da (Override), 910mal.mod (Modules), mus_a_kremov.mp3 (StreamMusic) and you will have reverted to TSLRCM 1.8.5.

4. Bugs:
----------
This has been tested several times to make sure nothing weird happens. If you find anything, let me know.

5. Compatibility:
----------
For this particular scene I’ve created several models

1) Lightsaber (no sound)
baseitems.2da - Added Row_104_Lightsaber_No_Sound
910.mod - g_w_lghtsbr_cut.uti

2) Characters (no sound)
appearance.2da - Added Row_692_Kreia_Evil_Fall_Cutscene_Only
910.mod - p_kreia_evil001.utc
