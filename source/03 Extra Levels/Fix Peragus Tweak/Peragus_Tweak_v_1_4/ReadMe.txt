Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me.
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You have anointed my head with oil
My cup overflows
 
Psalm 23: 4-5
 
Peragus Tweak 1.4
 
DESCRIPTION:
I was playing through Peragus and wondering why so many people want to skip through it and forget it. It's really a nice place, and it's too bad that some consider it to be quite a chore. I set out to make a mod that would remedy this problem. I don't know if I've succeeded quite yet at this point, but I think ultimately this is a good start

This mod adds a bit of content to the collection of modules you currently know as Peragus. The changes are
as follows:

- Random tan corpses have been replaced with actual dead miners. 
    + Non important characters have randomized appearances.
    + Security, Administrator, Med, Dock officers have individual corpses.
    + Coorta and thugs have individual corpses
    + Miners in the dormitories now match their appearances in the holorecords.
 
INSTALLATION:
Use the TSLPatcher. I'm sorry for the awkward installation procedure, but it's the best way I could figure out to make it work without... you know, redoing EVERYTHING. That will come for the next version of course. As it turns out, it'd just be easier to patch the .git... sigh.
 
UNINSTALLATION:
navigate to the backup folder and place the contents into the Modules folder. This should overwrite the modded .rims with the originals
