the lists in this folder contain a list of all tga and tpc textures that are currently included in the main project.

so it won't list any of the base games textures.

but it does include many textures required for the port.


tpc-list.txt

the above files do not exist in swpc_tex_gui.bif or swpc_tex_tpa.bif


exists-in-main-and-k2-base-files.txt

the above file contains a list of textures that exist in the main project and in the base files for TSL

and I cannot determine why I have them included

these are the first five files from the list

C_HK50.tga
C_HK51.tga

the above two have transparency where as the base games version of those files does not

DAN_ivy01.tga
DAN_ivy02.tga

the above two are at a lower resolution than the base games files, but if I remove them they disappear from the level they appear in which is 605dan in the model 605dank.mdl
I couldn't actually find a level or model that uses DAN_ivy02

DAN_Wn02.tga

the above file is identical to the one that exists in the base games files and when removed from the override causes no issues with the levels that it appears in the following models

301nara.mdl
301narg.mdl
306nara.mdl
306narb.mdl
610dan_01.mdl
