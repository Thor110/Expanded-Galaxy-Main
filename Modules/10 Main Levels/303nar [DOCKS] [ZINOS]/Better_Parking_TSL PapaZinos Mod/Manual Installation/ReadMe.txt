Don't Let Kreia Fly Your Speeder!

[Description:]
If you have ever fixed up your own speeder on Nar Shaddaa, you know how much work has to go into it. 
You might also notice that whoever takes your speeder to the docks not only crashes it through the railing but also parks it halfway onto the catwalk, 
missing the opening space for speeders almost entirely. How embarrassing! Breathe easy, there's a fix: install this mod and the Force will be with 
your parking job. 

You should have TSLRCM installed before this mod. For an existing game, use a save file made before visiting the docks for the 
first time (this mod won't affect save files made any later).

[Installation:]
Place the 303nar.mod file in this folder (not in backup) into your modules folder. For Steam installations, this would be 
"Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\208580\485537937\modules". For other installations, go to the modules folder inside your main game folder
(containing your executable).

[Uninstallation:]
Take the 303nar.mod folder out of the backup folder and put it inside the modules folder. Select "replace" when prompted.

[Modified Files:]
-303nar.mod

[Compatibility:]
Users should expect full compatibility with any other mods (such as geometry fixes or skybox changes to the Nar Shaddaa docks), so long as they do 
not modify/replace the above file. Requires TSLRCM 1.8.3 or higher.
